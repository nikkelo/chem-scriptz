# chemScriptz

Small collection of python scripts related to chemistry. Primarily used for routine tasks and created as a way to learn python. 

## List of scripts

As of latest update, the repository contains the following scripts:
- **molecular-weight** - calculates molecular weight of an inputted molecule (without checks)
- **sb-temperature-spectra** - plots temperature-dependant spectra with Seaborn based on a CSV file in the local directory. The given example is CAFFEINE Raman spectra.
- **sb-standard-calibration** - plots a calibration curve of concentration vs absorbance of a substance based on a CSV file in the local directory. The given example is ANTHOCYAN absorbance. 
- **PLANNED: IR-spectra-guessr** - guesses what an input wavenumber could correspond to from an IR spectrum. Estimates are based on an undergraduate practicum's table of IR bands.
